# Loop - WebKit-Inspired Rendering Engine

A high-performance web rendering engine built from scratch in Swift, inspired by WebKit's architecture and leveraging native macOS/iOS APIs.

## Overview

Loop is a modern web rendering engine designed to provide:

- **High Performance**: Built with Swift and low-level APIs like Metal, Core Text, and SIMD
- **Native Integration**: Seamless integration with macOS and iOS platforms
- **Standards Compliance**: Following W3C specifications for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between parsing, layout, rendering, and execution
- **Memory Efficiency**: Custom memory management and object pooling

## Architecture

The engine is organized into several key modules:

### Core Engine (`LoopEngine`)
- **Foundation**: Memory management, threading, data structures
- **DOM**: HTML document object model with full tree manipulation
- **Graphics**: Geometric primitives and rendering abstractions
- **Parser**: HTML5 and CSS3 parsing with proper error handling
- **Style**: CSS cascade, specificity, and computed style resolution
- **Layout**: Box model, flexbox, grid, and positioning algorithms
- **Rendering**: Paint operations and GPU-accelerated composition

### Browser UI (`LoopUI`)
- Web view components
- Navigation and tab management
- Developer tools integration
- Native scrolling and input handling

### Networking (`LoopNet`)
- HTTP/HTTPS resource loading
- Caching and compression
- Security policies (CORS, CSP)
- WebSocket support

### JavaScript Runtime (`LoopJS`)
- JavaScriptCore integration
- DOM API bindings
- Web API implementations
- Promise and async/await support

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed (Phase 1)
- [x] Core memory management system with object pooling
- [x] Reference counting for automatic memory management
- [x] High-performance geometric primitives using SIMD
- [x] Basic DOM node hierarchy with full tree manipulation
- [x] Element attribute and class management
- [x] HTML element registry and type checking

### ðŸš§ In Progress (Phase 2)
- [ ] HTML5 tokenizer and parser
- [ ] CSS lexer and parser
- [ ] Basic style computation and cascade
- [ ] Simple layout algorithms (block and inline)

### ðŸ“‹ Planned (Future Phases)
- [ ] Advanced layout (flexbox, grid, positioning)
- [ ] Rendering pipeline with Metal acceleration
- [ ] JavaScript engine integration
- [ ] Network resource loading
- [ ] Browser UI components

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- macOS 14.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/keviruchis/Developer/Loop
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open Loop.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and run**:
   - Select the Loop target
   - Press Cmd+R to build and run

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test suite
swift test --filter LoopEngineTests
```

### Swift Package Manager

You can also build using Swift Package Manager:

```bash
# Build all targets
swift build

# Build specific target
swift build --target LoopEngine

# Run tests
swift test
```

## Testing the Engine

The app includes several test functions to verify core functionality:

1. **DOM Creation Test**: Creates a basic DOM tree and tests manipulation
2. **Memory Pool Test**: Verifies custom memory allocation performance
3. **Geometry Test**: Tests SIMD-accelerated geometric operations

Click the test buttons in the app to see the engine in action.

## Performance Goals

- **Cold Start**: < 100ms to first paint
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for typical web pages
- **Scrolling**: 60fps smooth scrolling with GPU acceleration
- **JavaScript**: Performance competitive with V8/JavaScriptCore
- **Network**: Efficient resource loading with HTTP/2 support

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Use clear module boundaries between components
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep hot paths allocation-free
- Use Swift's type system for safety

### Performance
- Profile early and often
- Use Instruments for memory and CPU analysis
- Optimize critical paths with SIMD and Metal
- Implement object pooling for frequently allocated objects

### Memory Management
- Use custom allocators where beneficial
- Implement reference counting for DOM nodes
- Avoid retain cycles with weak references
- Pool objects to reduce allocation overhead

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all core functionality
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test with real-world web content
- Verify memory leak prevention
